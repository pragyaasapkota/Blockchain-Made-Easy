The concept of Blockchain and NFT is rapidly revolutionizing the whole web landscape. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are transforming the digital ownership aspect day by day and while most people grasp the idea of how these tokens work, some are still confused about the whole concept.

In today’s blog, you will learn some fundamentals of NFT minting that can get you started on the concept. We will also get into the process of creating and issuing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) more accessible and user-friendly for creators and users, i.e., enabling widespread NFT minting.

## What is NFT?

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the cryptographic assets representing ownership and proof of authenticity of any unique digital item or piece of content. Unlike fungible cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, NFTs are unique and in no way the tokens are interchangeable and equal in value. Each NFT has distinct properties and cannot be replicated or replaced. Each of the tokens holds metadata that includes details about the item it represents like its creator, creation date, and a unique identifier.

Over the past few years, NFTs have gained immense popularity and transcended the boundaries of traditional finance to permeate numerous economic sectors.

## How do NFTs work?

Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that stores all the transactions in a chain of computers. NFTs are built across a network of computers that helps ensure the authenticity, ownership, and provenance of each token. We can mostly see NFTs on Ethereum where smart contracts are used to facilitate transactions. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written into the code itself. These contracts automate the minting process, ownership transfer, and transaction records on the blockchain.

## What is NFT Minting?

NFT minting is a process of creating and issuing a new token. The process involves creating a unique digital asset and tokenizing it on a blockchain for transparency and authenticity of the item. In today’s date, most people prefer Ethereum for minting since it is widely accepted and also because it provides vigorous smart contracts. Other blockchain platforms like Tezos also support NFT minting.

Metadata containing the information about the digital item is attached to the token when the NFT is being minted. There are some token standards on Ethereum ERC-721 and ERC-1155 based on which the NFT minting can be done. The standard ERC-721 represents a single digital asset that is unique and indivisible and ERC-1155 represents multiple copies of an item or a collection of multiple items.

Minting an NFT also involves gas fees that can vary across network congestion and the complexity of the smart contract. These fees are only transaction fees used to compensate miners for validating and processing transactions on the network. While you are minting NFTs, you can have the option to embed royalty mechanisms into the smart contracts governing your NFTs so you can earn a percentage of the sale price each time the NFT is sold or transferred to a new owner in the secondary market. After completing the process, you can list your tokens for sale on various NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible, SuperRare, etc.

Finally, you should be aware of legal and copyright implications during the process if the asset holds any copyrighted materials or if there are disputes over ownership rights.

## Step-by-step guide to the minting process

Here is a detailed guide to the minting process. We will deploy our smart contract on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet. To get started, you need to install the MetaMask browser extension and some test ETH from QuickNode Multi-Chain Faucet. You need to connect the wallet and if you have 0.001ETH on the Mainnet, you can use the EVN faucets. Let’s see the steps one by one.

1. Open the terminal and start an IPFS repo

`ipfs init`

2. Open a separate terminal and start an IPFS daemon

`ipfs daemon`

3. Go back to the first terminal and add the image there with the .png file extension

`ipfs add image.png`

4. Copy the has that starts with Qm and add `https://ipfs.io/ipfs`. It will look something like `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPEVVUjuRi14T71sDttOzG4aodg`

5. Create a JSON file with the name `nft.json` and save it in the same directory as the image in step 3

```
{
“name”: NFT Image”’
“description”: “This image shows the nature of NFT.”
“image”: “https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPEVVUJURI14T71sDttOzG4aodg”
}
```

6. Add the JSON file

`ipfs add nft.json`

7. Take the hash with Qm and prefix it with `https://ipfs.io/ipfs`. It will then look like `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmIFnTguOpT51Bpahepn7BYU`. This URL will now be used to mint our NFT.

8. We will use OpenZeppelin ERC-721 contract for NFT creation and we do not need to write the whole interface but we can import the library contract and use its functions. Open Ethereum Remix IDE to create a Solidity file named `Token.sol` and paste this code into the script:

```
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
//pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import “@openzeppelin/contracts@5.0.0/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol”;
import “@openzeppelin/contracts@5.0.0/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol”;
import “@openzeppelin/contracts@5.0.0/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC712Burnable.sol”;
import “@openzeppelin/contracts@5.0.0/access/Ownable.sol”;

contract myToken is ERC721, ERC721URIStorage, ERC721Burnable, Ownable {
       constructor(address initialOwner)
              ERC721(“MyToken”, “MTK”)
              Ownable(initialOwner)
       {}
       function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenID, string memory uri)
               public
               onlyOwner
       {
             _safeMint(to, tokenID);
             _setTokenURI(tokenID, uri);
}
// overrides required by Solidity

   function tokenURI(uint256 tokenID)
       public
       view
       override(ERC721, ERC721URIStorage)
       returns (string memory)
   {
         Return super.tokenURI(tokenID);
    }
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID)
        public
        view
        override(ERC721, ERC721URIStorage)
       returns (bool)
   {
          Return super.supportsInterface(intergaceID);
     }
}
```

9. Now, use the OpenZeppelin ERC-721 contract and import the library contract to use its functions.

10. Get to Ethereum Remix IDE to create a new Solidity file with the new token name like — `NewToken.sol`

11. Prepare your Solidity script

```
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import “@openzeppelin/contracts@5.0.0/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol”;
import “@openzeppelin/contracts@5.0.0/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol”;
import “@openzeppelin/contracts@5.0.0/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Burnble.sol”;
import “@openzeppelin/contracts@5.0.0/access/ownable.sol”;

contract MyToken is ERC721, ERC721URIStorage, ERC721Burnable, Ownable {
        constructor(address initialOwner)
                ERC721(“NewToken”,”MTK”)
                Ownable(initialOwner)
       {}

Function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, string memory uri)
        Public
        onlyOwner
{
       _safeMint(to, tokenID);
       _setToeknURI(tokenID, uri);
}
// overrides required by Solidity

function tokenURI(uint256 tokenID)
      public
      view
      override(ERC721, ERC721URIStorage)
      returns (string memory)

{
          Return super.tokenURI(tokenID);
}


function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
         public
         view
         override(ERC721, ERC721URIStorage)
         returns (bool)
    {
         return super.supportsInterface(interfaceID);
     }
}
```

12. This code will now create a custom ERC721 token contract named NewToken so we as the contract owners can mint new tokens with metadata URIs and the support for the necessary interfaces defined by the ERC721 standard.

13. You now need to customize the contract with your details for a more personalized experience. You can update the token name with the line

`ERC721(“NewToken”,”MTK”)`

14. After the completion, you can compile the smart contract and deploy it with the Injected Provider before pasting your wallet address into the box just near the Deploy button to define the `initialOwner` inside the constructor function.

15. You need to click Deploy on Remix.IDE

16. Select the appropriate contract under the contract tab to avoid an error message before deployment.

17. Confirm the transaction in the MetaMask wallet and then go to the Deployed Contracts section in the IDE and see the functions/methods.

18. Check the safeMint function and add your wallet address in the **\_to** field.

19. Under the safeMint function, enter a big number value in the **\_tokenId** field and it is usually better to use “1” as it represents the first token.

20. Input the URI of the previously prepared JSON file in the **\_uri** field.

21. Click on Transact and confirm the transaction from MetaMask.

22. You have your NFT on the Sepolia chain. Check the metadata with tokenId.

## Enabling Widespread NFT Minting

There are many aspects of the concept where you can try to create tokens that are more accessible and user-friendly for the creators and users. Let’s see them one by one in different parts.

### 1. Enabling Widespread NFT Minting to simplify the process

#### a. User-friendly Interfaces

With the creation of NFT minting platforms that are both intuitive and easy to navigate, even users with no prior blockchain experience can have no trouble using them. Some of the interface’s features include drag-and-drop interfaces, clear instructions, and pre-built templates.

#### b. Wallet Integration

Integrating crypto wallets directly into the minting platform can eliminate the need for users to manage private keys or transfer funds between wallets.

#### c. Fiat on-ramps

Next, allowing users to pay for minting fees with traditional currency or fiat using credit cards or debit cards can help you remove the barrier for those who are not comfortable using cryptocurrency.

### 2. Enabling Widespread NFT Minting to reduce costs

#### a. Layer 2 solutions

We can use Layer 2 scaling solutions on top of blockchains so the gas fees associated with minting NFTs can be reduced. With these layer 2 solutions, we can handle transactions off the main blockchain, making them faster and cheaper.

#### b. Alternative blockchains

Moreover, we can explore all alternative blockchains that were designed for NFTs with lower transaction fees than Ethereum like Tezos and Solana.

### 3. Enabling Widespread NFT Minting to Encourage Creators

#### a. Royalties

You can also build royalty structures into the minting process so the creators can earn a percentage of every future sale of their NFT. Statistically, it has been shown that this incentivizes creators to participate in the NFT ecosystem.

#### b. Community Building

Integrating features that creators can use to connect their audience and build communities around their NFTs can go beyond for the long term. This means we need to have forums, chat rooms, and exclusive content for NFT holders.

### 4. Enabling Widespread NFT Minting for Education and Awareness

#### a. Educational Resources

Finally, we can hold clear and concise educational resources that will explain the definition and potential use cases of NFT alongside the minting process. You can upload regular blogs, tutorials, and video guides within the resources.

#### b. Highlighting Success Stories

You can also showcase your successful NFT projects and creators can inspire others to participate and demonstrate the potential benefits of NFTs.

## Potential Drawbacks of Enabling Widespread NFT Minting

There are some potential drawbacks to the widespread adoption.

### Environment Impact

The energy consumption of some blockchains used in NFTs can be significant and this raises concerns for the environmental impact. We can, however, look for solutions to address this concern.

### Market Volatility

Since the NFT market is still relatively new and volatile, investors need to be aware of the risks involved. This way the decision will be informed and educated.

## Conclusion

The bottom line is that widespread NFT minting brings immense potential to empower creators, open new avenues for ownership, and fuel innovation across various industries. As we move forward, prioritizing education, fostering collaboration, and developing responsible practices, can be the key to ensuring that widespread NFT minting fosters a thriving digital future.
